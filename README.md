# Stable Diffusion 2.0 Negative Prompting

Jupyter Notebooks for experimenting with negative prompting with Stable Diffusion 2.0. All these notebooks _should_ work in Colab (even with a K80 GPU).

These notebooks include:

- [3x3 Grid](sd_2_0_grid_3_x_3.ipynb): A notebook to generate images using Stable Diffusion 2.0 in a 3x3 grid using a cross of positive prompt additions and negative prompts/tokens.
- [Wrong Image Generator](wrong_image_generator.ipynb): A notebook to generate synthetic "negative" images for training the `<wrong>` textual inversion token.
