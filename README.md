# Stable Diffusion 2.0 Negative Prompting

Jupyter Notebooks for experimenting with negative prompting with Stable Diffusion 2.0. All these notebooks _should_ work in Colab (even with a K80 GPU).

These notebooks include:

- [Wrong Image Generator](wrong_image_generator.ipynb): A notebook to generate synthetic "negative" images for training the `<wrong>` textual inversion token.
